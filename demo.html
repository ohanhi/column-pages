Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p><p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Who are you, my warranty?! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. I'll get my kit!</p><p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p><p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. It's a T. It goes \"tuh\".

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p><p>You don't know how to do any of those. What are their names? Yeah, lots of people did.</p><p>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Daylight and everything. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.</p><p>Bender?! You stole the atom. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as \"the brig\". Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! What are their names?</p><p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as \"the brig\". Shinier than yours, meatbag. Bender! Ship!
